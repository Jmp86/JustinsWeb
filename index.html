          <p>
              My name is Justin Pitts and I'm 34 years old.  I live in Kihei,
            Maui in the state of Hawaii.  I'm married to my beautiful wife Rachel, and we have two dogs (Lambeau & Jasper).  I've lived in Kihei for a little over 24 years now.  
            Growing up in Hawaii is a little different than other places, it's very secluded 
            from the rest of the world. You're literally in the middle of the ocean. It's pretty much
            summer year round which can start to feel a little like the movie "Groundhogs Day".  My usual 
            yearly vacation tends to be spent on just visiting family on the mainland (continental-US).  My wife
            Rachel and I are planning to leave Hawaii in January 2022 to move to St. Louis, MO. St. Louis is where I plan to start
            my new career as a Full Stack Software Engineer.

              I'm currently the neighbor island Regional Manager for <a src = 'Media/MauiBlogPics3.png'>Honolulu Coffee</a>. I've worked at Honolulu Coffee for over 13 years now.  I started as a part-time barista which moved into a full time
            position.  From there I became a Barista trainer then eventually a Store Manager.  As Honolulu Coffee began to 
            expand I took on a bigger role of Regional Manager overseeing 4 locations spread across 2 islands.  I now frequently
            travel from Maui to the Big Island of Hawaii where 2 of my 4 stores are located. I've learned a lot while working for Honolulu Coffee. 
            I'm a very skilled barista with extensive coffee knowkedge.  I've hired, trained, and developed numerous employees and
            managers.  I understand the challenges of living in the middle of the ocean on islands that are separated from main distributers and each other. 
            I directly report to the owners of the company who have taught me invaluable lessons about running a business. I
            love the company that I work for and people that I work with but feel that it's time for a new adventure.
